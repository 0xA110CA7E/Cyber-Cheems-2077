## Info
Cyber-Cheems 2077 is a "cheat" for the Steam game Cyber-doge 2077: Meme runner. It allows you to get unlimited dogecoins(In-game currency, not the crypto).

Project I made to learn some stuff. By making this project I learned:
- Basic CE7.2 usage
- Basic ReClass usage
- Basic IDA Pro usage
- How to Read & Write Process memory in C++

## Disclaimer
This game has no multiplayer, leaderboard or in-game transactions. No game developers or other players have been harmed because of this project. This was simply made as a learning experience for myself. This project was only made for educational purposes.
